            <h2>Warning About Borrowing</h2>
            <p>It can be expensive to borrow small amounts of money and borrowing may not solve your money problems. Check your options before you borrow:</p>
            <ul class="ul-discs">
              <li>For information about other options for managing bills and debts, ring 1800 007 007 from anywhere in Australia to talk to a free and Independent financial counsellor</li>
              <li>Talk to your electricity, gas, phone or water provider to see if you can work out a payment plan</li>
              <li>If you are on government benefits, ask if you can receive an advance from Centrelink: <a href="www.humanservices.gov.au/advancepayments">www.humanservices.gov.au/advancepayments</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Government's MoneySmart website shows you how small amount loans work and suggests other options that may help you.</p>
            <p class="ts-6">* This statement is an Australian Government requirement under the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009.</p>
