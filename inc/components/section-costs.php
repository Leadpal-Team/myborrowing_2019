          <p class="color--secondary">A cash loan can be used to cover an unusual spike in expenses or an unusual shortfall in income. When you have repaid loans in full and on time, we will normally be able to provide another loan when requested. As responsible lenders, we always assess your circumstances for each loan. </p>
